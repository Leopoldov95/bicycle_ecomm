- refactor code

- display cart is empty if no items are present
- redirect to login if user tries to add to cart and is not logged in
- display certain errors on fail (login, account creation)
/// extra features ////
- bikes view css fix 
- handle expired session
- why is fetchCart being called twice? 
- need to STILL handle item num showing up when user logins
- update shopping state items when a new user is created
- allo shopping cart to be usable if no one is logged in, maybe if user is not loged in, push the shopping cart to a state/array (maybe set localstorage to 'guest') and once the user logs in, push thos items to the logged in users database
